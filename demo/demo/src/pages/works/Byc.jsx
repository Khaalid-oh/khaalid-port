          As a Frontend Tutor at Beyond Creativity, I was
          responsible for imparting my expertise and knowledge to aspiring
          frontend developers. My role involved breaking down complex
          technical concepts into easily understandable lessons and providing
          guidance and mentorship to ensure my students' success in the field.
          I worked closely with them to help them develop a deep understanding
          of front-end web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript,and React.
