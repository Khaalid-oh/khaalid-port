          As a designer/developer at Kabu, I designed and improved the user
          experience of their e-hailing app, resulting in a 20% increase in user
          engagement. My contributions led to an improvement in overall user
          satisfaction and retention rate. I also worked closely with the dev
          team to implement visual and interaction designs, and collaborate with
          Frontend engineers to ensure seamless integration with the underlying
          systems.
