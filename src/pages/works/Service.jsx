          As a designer/developer at A'service, an all inclusive service hub, I was
          responsible for designing and developing user interfaces that provide
          a seamless and intuitive experience for A'service's customers. I also
          worked closely with the design team to implement visual and
          interaction designs, and collaborate with backend engineers to ensure
          seamless integration with the underlying systems.
